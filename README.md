# DISCLAIMER
This script has been edited & converted to ESX by mips, @.qzwy on Discord. I do NOT provide any support. I do NOT take any credits for the original script. You can change everything in the config. For my next work, I'm probably going to convert the [Renewed-phone](https://github.com/Renewed-Scripts/qb-phone) next, not sure tho.

# ORIGINAL SCRIPT [HERE](https://github.com/planeklm/razed-cryptomining)

![RazedCryptoMining23](https://github.com/planeklm/razed-cryptomining/assets/91488137/2974fd19-33f9-409a-a1a1-194d1590237c)

**Hello FiveM community!üëã**\
We have created an crypto mining system for the qbcore framework. The overall idea for this script is that I have yet to find a free crypto miner which functions. Thank you to everybody who contributed to this project, I am very proud of what we have created!

# Features
* **7 graphics card upgrades** - If your players are needing an upgrade, they can choose 7 different tiers of graphics cards, from the GTS 480 to the RTS 4090.
* **Withdraw crypto with a set fee** - When the coins are withdrew, you can set a fee (default 10%).
*  **Crypto miner in houses** - With different housing scripts, you can place down the server rack prop to use the miner.
* **Lightweight and optimized** - We've tried to make the most lightweight and optimized script, this means it can run on virtually any server without sacrificing preformance.
* **Fully open-source & customizable** - Want to add more graphics cards? Or help us expand this script? We've made our script in the main idea of community collabration. Not sure what to do? We've made our config file with as many options to suit your server.
* **Configurable prices, props, fees and emails**

# Preview

# Installation
* Drag and drop `razed-cryptomining`
* In your `server.cfg` add `ensure razed-cryptomining`
* Execute the `cryptomining.sql` into your database

# Recomendations From Us
* If using `ps-housing` or `qb-housing`, we reccomend to change the price of the server rack prop to the appropriate price of a mining rig. You can use the server rack prop as a mining rig for houses or warehouses!

# Items & Images
**‚ù§Ô∏è to Markow (amsali22) for making this!**\
[razed-crypto-imgs](https://github.com/amsali22/razed-crypto-imgs)

* Drag and Drop the `images` to your inventory `images` folder.

* Add This to your `qb-core/shared/items.lua` For items to work.
